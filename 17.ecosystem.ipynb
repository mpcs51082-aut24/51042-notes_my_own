    "baking-pkg\n",
    "├── baking\n",
    "│   ├── __init__.py\n",

    "    ├── test_units.py\n",
    "    └── test_utils.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I gave you these files and you put them on your desktop, you would find that you could only use them if you were in the same directory.  That is if you put your own files in `baking-pkg` you would be able to `import baking` but otherwise it would fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type an `import` statement, Python uses an **environment variable** a variable set at the operating system level, not specific to Python named `PYTHONPATH` to look up what directories it should search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable contains a list of directories, which might resemble:\n",
    "\n",

    "- /home/user/james/.pipx/ruff/\n",
    "- /home/user/james/.pipx/jupyter/\n",
    "\n",
    "These directories are searched in order, so if I have a `math` library in `/home/user/james/.poetry/global/` it will supercede the built in math library in `/usr/lib/python3.10/`.\n",
